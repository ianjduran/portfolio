## Overview

Built a system with NodeMCU that works as a Dog Feeder capable of reading RFID tags to recognize a pet ID and give the appropiate amount of food. The pet owner is able to set wait times to control the diet of their pet.

An SQL database is used to store the pet's attempts via HTTP requests using an API built with NodeJS and Express.

Moreover, a Telegram bot was implemented and hosted into a Raspberry Pi, where the owner can different actions such as:

- Take a photo of their pet.

- Receive information and statistics about the dog's diet.
