## Overview

MP3 Player developed as a Final Project for TE2003B Course at Tecnológico de Monterrey.

Developed an embedded system capable of playing music and displaying relevant information (E.g. Title, Author Album, etc) about the current song
via LCD. The mp3 player was implemented in a Raspberry Pi that also stores all the user’s song.

The project was implemented using CMSIS-RTOS2 to have multiple task running concurrently.
